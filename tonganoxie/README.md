Tonganoxie is a library for manipluating 3D artifacts as 
3D meshes, called 'Object'. These objects are a graph of
points connected by edges (a mesh) and the faces of this
mesh can have materials associated with them.

Tonganoxie provides ways of reading and writing complete 3D
artifacts using the standard `.obj` file format, as well as
ways of constructing and maniplating 3D actifacts in-situ.
